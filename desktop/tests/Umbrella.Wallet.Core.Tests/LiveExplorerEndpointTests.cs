// Category=Live is what CI filters on. Without it these run on every pull request, hammering free
// public explorers from GitHub runners and failing the build whenever one of them rate-limits the
// runner - a flake with nothing to do with the change under test. The rest of the suite was taken
// offline for exactly this reason; this file reintroduced the problem by being named after the other
// convention, and LiveTestTraitTests now stops that recurring.
