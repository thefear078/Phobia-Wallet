/// them WHO that person pays, under labels the user wrote in their own words — "landlord", "mum",
/// "the lawyer" — tied to addresses that can be looked up on a public chain. It survived a wallet
/// delete until 4.7, and it sat in the clear the whole time.
///
/// So it is now sealed the same way private transaction notes are: AES-256-GCM under a key derived
/// from the wallet seed, readable exactly while the wallet is unlocked and meaningless to anything
/// that copies the file. Same crypto, same fail-closed handling — a corrupt or foreign file reads as
/// an empty book, never a crash.

/// An existing plaintext book is migrated on the first unlock and the plaintext is then deleted. The
/// migration is one-way on purpose: there is no path back to the readable file.
