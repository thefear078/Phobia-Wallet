/// answers "what is the balance of bc1q…" learns that address belongs to a wallet, and can tie every
/// address asked about in one session to one person. Tor hides the IP. It does not un-send the
/// address.
///
/// So this is not a marketing page. It is the list, with what each party learns stated plainly, and

/// than none, because it reassures without being true.
