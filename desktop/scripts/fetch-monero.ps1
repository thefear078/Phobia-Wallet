<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Downloads a PINNED, hash-verified Monero CLI bundle and stages monero-wallet-rpc.exe so the
    desktop wallet can run Monero in-process (real balance + real sending).

.DESCRIPTION
    The binary is ~85 MB of third-party build output and is deliberately not committed, so a fresh
    clone runs this once. The version and its SHA-256 are pinned from Monero's official signed
    hashes.txt (see THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). The downloaded archive is verified against that hash
    before extraction and the build FAILS CLOSED on any mismatch — a tampered or wrong binary must
    never make it into a release.
