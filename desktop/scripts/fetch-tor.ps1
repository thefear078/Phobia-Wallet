.SYNOPSIS
    Downloads the official Tor Expert Bundle and stages tor.exe + GeoIP databases so the
    desktop wallet can run Tor in-process.

.DESCRIPTION
    The binaries are deliberately not committed (~35 MB of third-party build output), so a
    fresh clone runs this once. The build copies whatever lands in the tor/ folder into the
    application output, and the Inno Setup installer packages it from there.

    # The version is part of the URL, and the Tor Project PRUNES old releases from the mirror — a pin
    # left behind becomes a 404 rather than an old-but-working download. It has happened twice: 15.0.22
    # and then 15.0.23 vanished upstream (the supply-chain CI job caught the second). The hash below is
