<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Downloads the official Tor Expert Bundle and stages tor.exe + GeoIP databases so the
    desktop wallet can run Tor in-process.

.DESCRIPTION
    The binaries are deliberately not committed (~35 MB of third-party build output), so a
    fresh clone runs this once. The build copies whatever lands in the tor/ folder into the
    application output, and the Inno Setup installer packages it from there.
