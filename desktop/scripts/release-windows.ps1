  release-windows.ps1 — one-shot Windows release for Phobia Wallet (desktop).

  Produces, under $OutRoot (default D:\umbrella-dist, which the Inno Setup script expects):
    app\         folder publish that the installer bundles
    portable\    self-contained single-file Umbrella.Wallet.App.exe
    PhobiaWallet-Setup-<version>.exe   the installer (built by ISCC)

  The version is read from the .csproj so it always matches VERSION / the .iss.
  Run from anywhere:  pwsh desktop/scripts/release-windows.ps1
  Requires: the .NET 8 SDK on PATH, and Inno Setup 6 (ISCC.exe) for the installer step.
