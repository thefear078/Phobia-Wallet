## What this is

Umbrella is a desktop wallet for Windows and Linux that holds your keys and nothing else of yours.

Your 24-word seed is generated on your machine, encrypted into a local vault with your password
(Argon2id → AES-256-GCM), and never leaves the device. There is no server that knows you exist. There
is no account to create, nothing to verify, and no way for us — or anyone holding this software — to
freeze, seize, or recover your funds.

It holds sixteen chains in one vault — plus the Ethereum networks that share your 0x address —
including Monero as a **full** wallet rather than a receive-only stub, and ships Tor inside the binary
so your balance lookups don't hand your IP address to a block explorer. What each chain can do today,
receive, balance or send, is in [Coins](#coins) — nothing is listed as working before it does.

## Why it exists

Most wallets ask you to trade privacy for convenience, and most of them don't say so plainly.

- Exchange wallets hold your keys and know your identity.
- Most "private" wallets do one chain well. Feather is Monero. Sparrow is Bitcoin. If you hold both,
  you run both.
- Wallets with Tor support usually make you configure it. Which means most people don't.
- Nearly every wallet takes a cut of your transfers, and many bury it.

Umbrella is the wallet we wanted to exist: one vault for the coins people actually hold together,
Tor as a switch instead of a setup guide, and no cut of your money.

## What makes it different

**Monero and Bitcoin and USDT in one vault.**
Not a Monero wallet with Bitcoin bolted on, and not a Bitcoin wallet that shows XMR as "coming soon".
Monero runs the real `monero-wallet-rpc` locally over loopback, so its balance is computed on your
machine because no explorer can compute it for you.

**Tor is bundled, not assumed.**
One switch. The wallet starts its own Tor client on port 9250 — separate from a Tor Browser you may
already be running — and routes every balance lookup, price fetch and broadcast through it. There is
also a kill-switch: when it's on, a request that cannot go through Tor does not go at all.

**The Security Center tells you the truth, not a promise.**
It reads live settings and reports what is *actually* protecting the wallet right now. If Tor is off,
it says your IP is visible to every explorer you use. It will not flatter you.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/assets/screenshot-security-v48.png" width="80%" alt="Security Center"/>
</div>

**You choose which server sees your addresses.**
A wallet cannot read a chain by itself — it has to ask somebody, and on a transparent chain asking
means *saying the address*. Tor hides your IP; it does not un-send an address. So Settings → Privacy
names every server the wallet talks to and what each one learns, and lets you point any chain
somewhere else — a different company, or a node you run. Monero, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash,
Dogecoin, Ethereum, Solana, TON, Tron, Cardano, XRP, Stellar, Cosmos, NEAR and Polkadot.

Two rules are enforced rather than suggested: a `.onion` node is never used without Tor and is never
silently swapped for a clearnet one, and a plain `http://` endpoint is refused outright — choosing
your own server *for privacy* and then sending addresses in clear would be worse than not choosing.

**Privacy Radar.**
Before you send, the wallet reads the transaction you are about to make and tells you what it would
reveal on-chain — chiefly whether it links coins that were previously unconnected, which is how chain
analysis de-anonymises people. The analysis runs offline, on your own data, for you.

**No cut of your transfers.**
You pay the network's miner/validator fee and nothing else. See [What this costs](#what-this-costs).

The default look is gold light on black: charts drawn as lines of light, and every Umbrella logo in the
app tinted to the theme you pick — only the desktop icon keeps its own colours. **20 themes**, each with
its own character rather than one accent swapped around (the original navy is still there):

## Coins

Every row in the wallet prints the network under the coin name, because sending on the wrong network
is the most common way people lose money.

| Coin | Receive | Balance | Send | History | Swap | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Bitcoin (BTC) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | BIP84 native SegWit, full HD scan |
| Ethereum (ETH) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | + every ERC-20 at the same address — **and now sendable**, fee in ETH |
| Litecoin (LTC) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | BIP84, full HD scan |
| Dogecoin (DOGE) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | real UTXO spend |
| Bitcoin Cash (BCH) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | CashAddr, SIGHASH_FORKID |
| Monero (XMR) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | local `monero-wallet-rpc`, loopback only |
| Solana (SOL) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | SPL tokens send too, Token-2022 (PayPal USD) included when its extensions allow |
| TRON (TRX) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | + every TRC-20 at the same address |
| USDT (TRC-20) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | same address as TRX; fee paid in TRX |
| TON | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | wallet v4R2, pinned to `@ton/ton` |
| Cardano (ADA) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | CIP-1852, BIP32-Ed25519 |
| Zcash (ZEC) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | **transparent `t1…` only** — not shielded |
| XRP Ledger (XRP) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | destination tag for exchange deposits; an address becomes an account once it receives the network's reserve |
| Stellar (XLM) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | SEP-0005, restores in LOBSTR / Solar / Ledger; memo for exchange deposits |
| Cosmos Hub (ATOM) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | memo for exchange deposits; the balance is *available* ATOM — staked ATOM is not counted |
| NEAR Protocol (NEAR) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | from your implicit account, to any `.near` name or implicit account |
| Polkadot (DOT) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — | sr25519, same account as Polkadot.js / Nova; balance adds Asset Hub + relay; sends from Asset Hub |
| Linea (ETH) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | — | same `0x` as mainnet |
| zkSync Era (ETH) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | — | the gas comes from zkSync's own estimate, not Ethereum's 21,000 |

Plus the native coin of every major EVM network at the same `0x` address (BNB, MATIC, AVAX, FTM, CRO,
and ETH on Arbitrum / Optimism / Base), and NFTs listed by name and count with **no image fetch**, so
viewing them never leaks your IP.

Swaps are non-custodial via THORChain: your coin goes to a THORChain vault with a signed memo and the
network delivers to your own address. Nobody holds your funds in between.

## Download

<img src="docs/assets/logo-umbrella-v48.png" width="64" align="left" alt="" hspace="14"/>

Builds are published on the [releases page](https://github.com/thefear078/UmbrellaWallet/releases/latest).
This is the icon you will see once it is installed.

<br clear="left"/>

| | |
|---|---|
| **Windows installer** | `UmbrellaWallet-Setup-4.9.0.exe` |
| **Windows portable** | `UmbrellaWallet-4.9.0-win-x64-portable.exe` — one file, no install, leaves nothing behind |
| **Linux** | `UmbrellaWallet-4.9.0-linux-x64.tar.gz` |

Portable mode matters if you don't want the wallet to be installed on the machine at all: it runs
from the file you downloaded and keeps its data next to it.

### Verify what you downloaded

Every release ships `SHA256SUMS-<version>.txt`. Check it before you run anything:

```bash
# Linux / macOS — run in the folder with the download and the sums file
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS-4.9.0.txt
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell — compare against the matching line in the sums file
Get-FileHash .\UmbrellaWallet-Setup-4.9.0.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

If the hash does not match, do not run it. Better still, [build it yourself](docs/building.md) — the
build is deterministic enough that you can compare your own binary against the published one.

## Get started

1. **Create** a new wallet, or **import** any BIP39 phrase (12/15/18/21/24 words) from another wallet.
   The derived addresses will match the original exactly.
2. Write the 24 words on **paper**. The wallet then asks you for three of them at random — not
   theatre, it is the only way to catch a phrase you wrote down wrong while it still costs nothing.
3. Turn **Tor** on in Settings *before* you unlock, if you don't want your addresses queried over
   clearnet even once.
4. Send a **small test amount** to any new address first. A blockchain transfer is final.

While your seed phrase or Monero keys are on screen, the window is excluded from screenshots and
screen sharing. A camera pointed at the screen still works, so reveal them alone.

```

**The rule the layout enforces:** `Core` never touches the network, so every piece of money logic —
derivation, UTXO selection, fee maths, amount parsing, privacy analysis — is testable offline against
known vectors. Anything that talks to the outside world lives in `Infrastructure` and goes through one
Tor-aware HTTP client.

### What leaves your device

| Never leaves | Leaves (to public explorers / RPCs) |
|---|---|
| Your seed phrase | The addresses you look up |
| Every private key | Transactions you broadcast |
| Your vault password | Coin prices you fetch |
| Your private transaction notes | *(all of it behind Tor when Tor is on)* |

There is no account, no email, no telemetry and no analytics of any kind.

## Build it yourself

You need the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0). Nothing else.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thefear078/UmbrellaWallet.git
cd UmbrellaWallet
dotnet build desktop/Umbrella.Wallet.sln -c Release
```

```bash
# run it
dotnet run --project desktop/src/Umbrella.Wallet.App
```

```bash
# the full offline test suite — no network required
dotnet test desktop/Umbrella.Wallet.sln -c Release --filter 'FullyQualifiedName!~LiveExplorer'
```

Producing installers, the portable build and checksums is documented in
**[docs/building.md](docs/building.md)**.

## Tests

More than 1,190 offline tests, run on every push by [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml). They are not there
for a badge — several classes of them exist because the alternative is losing money:

- **Derivation** is pinned byte-for-byte to official test vectors and to the reference libraries
  (`@ton/ton` for TON, `cardano-serialization-lib` for ADA). An address the wallet shows you is an
  address the original wallet would show.
- **Amount parsing** is pinned because `"0,5"` parsed naively reads as `5` — ten times the amount.
- **Spend planning** is pinned so a partial network scan can never quietly lower a balance, and a fee
  level can never drop below the relay floor and strand a transaction.
- **Localization parity** fails if any language is missing a key, so a feature cannot silently render
  in English inside a translated wallet.
- **Theme contrast** fails if body text, muted text, or a button label falls below WCAG AA.
- **Signing** for every new format — Taproot, PSBT, PayJoin, Stellar — is pinned to transactions the
  reference implementations build (BIP test vectors, NBitcoin, the Stellar Go SDK), never to the
  wallet's own output.
- **Busy explorers** are pinned too: a timeout is not a cancel, a 429 is waited out, and an unread
  balance is never shown as zero.

`--filter "Category!=Live"` excludes the handful of tests that hit real explorers, so the default run
is fully offline and deterministic.

## Diagnostics

| Symptom | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Balance is slow or missing | Security Center → is Tor on? Tor adds latency by design |
| Monero balance stuck at "Scanning…" | It is a real wallet syncing, not an API call — it takes time |
| A coin shows "Not ready" | That chain's adapter is not implemented; it is never a fake address |
| Send fails with "not synced" | A partial scan refuses to spend rather than risk a wrong balance |
| An unknown token appeared | Suspected spam airdrops are folded away — see the notice above Holdings |

More in **[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)**.

## What this costs

**Umbrella takes no cut of your transfers.** You pay the network's own miner/validator fee and nothing
else — no platform fee, no subscription, no withdrawal fee, no account fee. A wallet that holds your
own keys should not charge you for touching your own money.

It is funded instead by:

- **[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/thefear078)**
- **Bounties** — anyone can fund a specific coin or feature
- **A small swap spread**, later and only on swaps, which are optional in a way a send is not

There is no advertising and no tracking, and there will not be. Those are the two things that would
make everything else on this page untrue.

## Security

The short version:

- Seed generated with the OS CSPRNG, 256-bit entropy, BIP39.
- Vault: Argon2id (m=64 MiB, t=4, p=2) → AES-256-GCM with versioned associated data.
- Keys are decrypted into memory only for the moment they are used, then zeroed.
- Seed and key screens set `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`, so screenshots and screen sharing see nothing.
- Auto-lock on idle and on minimise; `Ctrl+L` locks instantly.
- Every network call goes through one Tor-aware client; the kill-switch makes "no Tor" mean "no
  request", not "quietly direct".

The long version, including the threat model and what Umbrella explicitly does **not** protect you
from, is in **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

## The honest part

- A blockchain transfer is **final**. Nobody can reverse it — not us, not a support desk.
- If you lose the 24 words **and** the vault password, the funds are gone. That is what self-custody
  means, and it is the trade you are making for nobody being able to freeze them.
- Tor hides your IP from explorers. It does not make a transparent chain private: Bitcoin, Ethereum
  and the rest are public ledgers, and Privacy Radar exists to tell you what yours reveals.
- Zcash here is transparent addresses only. It is listed that way rather than implying shielded
  privacy the wallet does not provide.
- No external security audit has been done yet — see [AUDIT_STATUS.md](AUDIT_STATUS.md). Tests and
  public CI are evidence, not a substitute.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and
[docs/forking.md](docs/forking.md) if you are building on top of this.

Anything touching the send path, the vault, or key derivation needs tests. That is not bureaucracy:
those are the paths where a bug costs somebody their money.
