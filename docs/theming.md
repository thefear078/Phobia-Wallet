# Theming

15 themes. Adding one is about twenty lines of colour — but the tests will hold you to a standard,
and the standard exists because a wallet you cannot read is a wallet that loses you money.

## Where

`App/Theming.cs` — the theme list and every palette.
`App/App.axaml` — the styles that consume the tokens.

Every themed surface binds a `DynamicResource`, so switching a theme repaints the whole window with no
restart.

## Adding a theme

**1. Register it**

```csharp
public static IReadOnlyList<ThemeOption> Themes { get; } =
[
    …
    new("yourtheme", "Your Theme · what it feels like"),
];
```

The name is `Identity · character`, not `Identity · colour`. "Kraken · abyssal violet" tells you what
the theme feels like; "Kraken · purple" tells you nothing you couldn't see.

**2. Add the palette** — 22 colours, in the order `Keys` declares:

```csharp
["yourtheme"] =
[
    // bg        bgAlt      card       input      cardAlt    hover
    "#07060A", "#0C0A12", "#121019", "#0E0C15", "#1C1826", "#262034",
    // bd        bd2        bd3
    "#1A1626", "#282236", "#3A3250",
    // accent    accentBr   accentHv   accentSel  accentDim
    "#7C3AED", "#9945FF", "#B06BFF", "#241546", "#1B1035",
    // text      textSoft   textDim    textMut    pos
    "#F4F1FA", "#D2CCE4", "#9B93B0", "#7A7291", "#14F195",
    // inverse   inverseHv  inverseTx
    "#F4F1FA", "#FFFFFF", "#07060A",
],
```

**3. Run the tests.** They will tell you exactly what is wrong.

```bash
dotnet test desktop/Umbrella.Wallet.sln -c Release --filter 'FullyQualifiedName~Theming'
```

## What the tests require

| Test | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Completeness | Every theme in the picker has a palette with all 22 colours, all parseable |
| Uniqueness | No two themes share ids or names |
| Distinctness | No two themes share the same `UmBg` + `UmAccentBright` + `UmPos` |
| **No shared gain colour** | Every theme has its own `UmPos` |
| Body contrast | `UmText` on `UmBgAlt` ≥ **4.5:1** (WCAG AA) |
| Muted contrast | `UmTextMuted` on `UmCard` ≥ **3:1** |
| Button contrast | The auto-chosen label on `UmAccentBright` ≥ **4.5:1** |
| Accent ≠ gain | The accent and `UmPos` must be visibly different |

### Why "no shared gain colour"

Five themes once shared the exact same green. The result was that picking a different theme mostly
meant "the same app with another accent" — the number people look at most never changed. Give your
theme its own green.

For a brand theme, use that brand's real up-colour. Binance gains are Binance green (`#0ECB81`),
Telegram's are Telegram green, Solana's are `#14F195`. It is a small detail that makes the theme feel
authentic rather than approximated.

### Button label colour is automatic

Do not set it. `Theming.AccentTextFor` compares near-black and white against your accent by actual
WCAG contrast and picks whichever reads better.

This used to be a brightness threshold, and a mid-bright accent (Sunset's coral) fell just under the
line and got white text at 2.9:1 — when dark text on the same colour gives 6.8:1. Comparing the two
candidates removes the guess and keeps working for any accent added later.

## Give it a real identity

The difference between a theme and a recoloured default is the **base**, not the accent.

| Theme | What makes it itself |
|---|---|
| Ember | warm charcoal — the base carries the red, rather than red dropped on neutral grey |
| Void | true `#000000` OLED black with electric cyan |
| Matrix | phosphor green on dead black; the accent *is* the text colour family |
| Kraken | abyssal indigo lit from below, bioluminescent teal for gains |
| Abyss | sunless-zone water |
| Solarized | the only theme whose base is a colour rather than a near-black |

If your palette is Navy with a different `UmAccentBright`, the distinctness test may pass but you have
not really added a theme.

## One signature, every theme

The home screen, the navigation and the charts use the same treatment on every theme, in that theme's
own colours: dark surfaces, and the accent used as light. `Theming.PublishSignature` writes the tokens
for it — the active sidebar page is a wash of the accent fading to the right, the action tiles are dark
with accent icons and an accent hairline on hover — and every theme sets every one of them, so nothing
from the previous theme lingers after a switch.

**Logos follow the theme.** The in-app logos are `Controls/BrandMark`: the artwork's silhouette used as a
mask over `UmMarkFill` (a gradient of the theme's accent), plus a layer that shades it or stays dark.
Four kinds, all from the original artwork — the folded mark (the sidebar tile), the wordmark (welcome,
unlock), the umbrella glyph (the sidebar card) and the canopy seen from above (the splash). Only the
desktop icon, `umbrella.ico`, keeps fixed colours. The masks are drawn with high-quality scaling; the
default sampling turned their edges into steps.

**Chart lines are light.** Every price line — the market chart, its row sparklines, the balance chart —
is a smooth curve (`ChartGeometry`: Catmull-Rom through every sample, clamped so it never overshoots a
high or a low the data did not reach) in the accent, with a soft glow and a wash of it underneath.
Up or down is said by the change figures in green or red, not by the line.

**Light behind the window.** Two long arcs of the accent sit behind every card (`UmGlow` stops), static
and never hit-testable.

## Gradients

A theme can paint the page as a sweep instead of a flat fill:

```csharp
private static readonly HashSet<string> GradientThemes =
    new(StringComparer.Ordinal) { "sunset", "solana", "umbrella" };
```

Add your id and a stop list in `GradientBackground`. Keep it dark enough to stay a background — a
gradient that competes with the content makes every number harder to read.

## Light themes

`IsLightTheme` is derived from the palette's own background luminance, not a hardcoded id. If you add
a light theme it is detected automatically, and the card sheen inverts so it darkens instead of
blowing out to white.

The logos follow the theme (see above), but coin tiles and some illustrations are still
light-on-transparent, which is why there is no full light theme shipped yet.

## The one thing that is never themed

**The QR plate in Receive stays white.** A QR code needs dark-on-light contrast to scan. Tinting it
would break receiving for some scanners — silently, and only for some users.
