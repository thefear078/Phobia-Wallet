# Building Phobia

Everything from "clone it" to "produce the same installer we publish".

## Reproducible builds

The same commit compiles to the same bytes, from any directory. Check it yourself:

```bash
./scripts/verify-reproducible-build.sh
```

It clones the repository at the current commit to a different absolute path, builds both, and compares
the three assemblies that actually run. It does not compare the self-contained publish output — that
also bundles the .NET runtime, which comes from NuGet and is identical by construction.

### Why this matters

Without it, verifying a published `SHA256SUMS` file proves only that the download was not corrupted in
transit. The manifest comes from the same release an attacker would have had to compromise. With
reproducibility, anyone can rebuild from the tag and prove the binary **is** the source.

### How it was diagnosed

`Deterministic` is already the .NET default, and it works: two builds in the same directory were
byte-identical before any of this was configured. What differed was the same source built from a
different directory.

Measured, same commit, two absolute paths, `Umbrella.Wallet.Core.dll` (176 KB):

| `DebugType` | Result |
|---|---|
| `portable` (default) | differs — **735 bytes** |
| `embedded` | differs — the embedded blob is path-dependent too |
| `none` | **byte-identical** |

The differing bytes were clustered, and one block was exactly **29 bytes longer** on one side with
every subsequent offset shifted by the same 29 — the difference in the length of the **absolute path
to the `.pdb`**, which the debug directory embeds and which the MVID then depends on.

Two false leads are worth recording, because both produced confident wrong numbers:

- An early measurement said 2203 bytes. That compared a build inside a git repository against a build
  in a plain copied folder — the SDK appends the commit SHA to `AssemblyInformationalVersion` only in
  the former. The test, not the build, was at fault.
- A `DebugType=none` run appeared to change nothing. MSBuild had considered the project up to date and
  skipped compilation entirely; the output was a copy of the previous build.

### What is configured

`desktop/Directory.Build.props`:

- `Deterministic` — explicit rather than relied upon as a default
- `PathMap` — rewrites embedded source paths to a fixed token, so no absolute path reaches the binary
- `DebugType` — `none` for **Release**, `portable` for Debug. Reproducibility matters for the artifact
  users download; line numbers matter while developing, where the build is already at hand.

`global.json` pins the SDK to the patch level. A different compiler version produces different output,
so a verifier must use the same one.

### What is still missing

Signed binaries. Reproducibility proves the binary matches the source; a signature proves the release
came from whoever holds the key. They answer different questions and the wallet has only the first.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **.NET 8 SDK** | the only hard requirement — [download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) |
| **Inno Setup 6** | Windows installer only. [jrsoftware.org](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) |
| Disk | ~2 GB for the SDK, NuGet cache and a self-contained publish |

No Node, no Python, no Docker. The UI is Avalonia, not a web view.

## Clone, build, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thefear078/Phobia-Wallet.git
cd UmbrellaWallet
dotnet build desktop/Umbrella.Wallet.sln -c Release
```

```bash
dotnet run --project desktop/src/Umbrella.Wallet.App
```

A clean build should end with **0 warnings, 0 errors**. Warnings are not tolerated here — XAML
bindings are compiled (`x:CompileBindings`), so binding mistakes are build errors rather than blank
labels you discover later.

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test desktop/Umbrella.Wallet.sln -c Release --filter 'FullyQualifiedName!~LiveExplorer'
```

The filter excludes the few tests that hit real block explorers. Everything else — 526 tests — is
fully offline and deterministic, so this works on a plane.

To run the live ones as well (needs network, and they can fail for reasons that are not your fault):

```bash
dotnet test desktop/Umbrella.Wallet.sln -c Release
```

See [testing.md](testing.md) for what the suite actually covers.

## Bundled binaries: Tor and Monero

The wallet ships a Tor client and `monero-wallet-rpc` inside the build. They are **not** in git — they
are fetched and hash-verified by scripts:

```powershell
desktop/scripts/fetch-tor.ps1
desktop/scripts/fetch-monero.ps1
```

Both are idempotent: if the binary is already staged, they skip the download. Both verify a pinned
SHA-256 against the official release before staging anything.

> **Antivirus note.** `monero-wallet-rpc` is a well-known false positive — several engines flag Monero
> tooling as a miner. If Windows Defender blocks the copy, the fetch script will fail *after* the hash
> check has already passed. Allowing it is your decision; the build will otherwise produce a wallet
> without Monero balance/send support and everything else intact.

## Producing a release

One command does the lot on Windows:

```powershell
pwsh desktop/scripts/release-windows.ps1
```

It produces, under `D:\umbrella-dist` by default:

| Output | What it is |
|---|---|
| `app\` | folder publish — what the installer packages |
| `portable\Phobia.exe` | single-file, self-contained, no install |
| `PhobiaWallet-Setup-<version>.exe` | the Inno Setup installer |

Override the output root or the compiler path if your machine differs:

```powershell
pwsh desktop/scripts/release-windows.ps1 -OutRoot C:\dist -Iscc "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe"
```

To skip the installer step entirely:

```powershell
pwsh desktop/scripts/release-windows.ps1 -SkipInstaller
```

### The version comes from one place

`desktop/src/Umbrella.Wallet.App/Umbrella.Wallet.App.csproj` → `<Version>`.

The release script reads it and passes it to the installer compiler. The `.iss` no longer carries its
own copy — it used to, and it drifted: a 4.6.0 build once shipped as `Setup-4.5.0.exe`. If you compile
the `.iss` directly, it reads the version out of the published exe instead, so it still cannot name
itself after a stale literal.

### Doing it by hand

If you'd rather run the steps yourself:

```bash
# folder publish (what the installer packages)
dotnet publish desktop/src/Umbrella.Wallet.App/Umbrella.Wallet.App.csproj \
  -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=false -o dist/app

# portable single file
dotnet publish desktop/src/Umbrella.Wallet.App/Umbrella.Wallet.App.csproj \
  -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true -o dist/portable
```

Then rename the apphost in **both** output folders:

```
Umbrella.Wallet.App.exe  →  Phobia.exe
```

This is safe and it is what the release script does. The assembly stays `Umbrella.Wallet.App` so
`avares://` resource URIs keep resolving; the apphost loads its dll by the **embedded** name, not by
its own filename.

> Skipping the rename is how a stale `Phobia.exe` from a previous version survives a "deploy" that
> only copied DLLs. If the app reports an old version after you built a new one, check this first.

Finally, compile the installer:

```powershell
& "$env:LocalAppData\Programs\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" /DAppVersion=4.6.0 desktop\installer\umbrella.iss
```

## Linux

```bash
dotnet publish desktop/src/Umbrella.Wallet.App/Umbrella.Wallet.App.csproj \
  -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -o dist/linux
tar -czf PhobiaWallet-4.10.0-linux-x64.tar.gz -C dist/linux .
```

## Android

The phone app is `desktop/src/Umbrella.Wallet.Android` — Avalonia's Android host around the same App
project, shown through `Views/MobileShell.axaml`. It is not in `Umbrella.Wallet.sln`, so the desktop
build and tests need no Android tooling. It needs the .NET 8 SDK with the Android workload, a JDK 17 and
an Android SDK:

```bash
dotnet workload install android
./desktop/scripts/publish-android.sh          # -> desktop/dist/android/phobia-wallet-<version>-android.apk
```

Without a key the APK is signed with the SDK's debug key, which is fine for trying it. A release signs
with `ANDROID_KEYSTORE`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` and `ANDROID_KEY_PASS` set (the release workflow reads them
from the `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_B64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` and `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` repository secrets).
Android installs an update only over a copy signed with the same key, so that key is kept, not rotated.
The versionCode is `major·1000000 + minor·10000 + patch·100 + beta` (99 for a full release); a test keeps
it in step with `VERSION`.

## Checksums

Publish a `SHA256SUMS-<version>.txt` next to the artifacts so people can verify what they downloaded:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\PhobiaWallet-Setup-4.10.0.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

```bash
sha256sum PhobiaWallet-Setup-4.10.0.exe PhobiaWallet-4.10.0-win-x64-portable.exe \
  > SHA256SUMS-4.6.0.txt
```

Generate them from the **final** files, after every rename and replacement. A sums file assembled
mid-process can mix an old hash with a new artifact, which is worse than having none.

## Reproducing a published build

Reproducible builds are on the roadmap, not done. Today you can get close:

1. Check out the tag for the release (`git checkout v4.6.0`).
2. Build with the same SDK feature band.
3. Compare the *payload* — DLLs, assets — rather than the installer, which embeds a timestamp.

If you find a discrepancy you cannot explain, please
[report it privately](https://github.com/thefear078/Phobia-Wallet/security/advisories/new) rather than
opening a public issue. See [BUILD_VERIFY.md](BUILD_VERIFY.md) for the current verification notes.

## Common build problems

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `MSB3021: cannot copy … used by another process` | The app (or a previous publish) is still running. Close it. |
| `error CS1061` after editing a record | Positional record parameters changed; update the call sites. |
| XAML binding error at build time | Correct — `x:CompileBindings` is on. Fix the binding. |
| `monero-wallet-rpc` copy fails | Antivirus false positive. See the note above. |
| Localization parity test fails | You added a key to one language only. Add it everywhere. |
| Theme contrast test fails | A palette's text dropped below WCAG AA. See [theming.md](theming.md). |
