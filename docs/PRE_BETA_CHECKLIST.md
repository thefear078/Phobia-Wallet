# Pre-beta checklist

**Last verified:** 2026-09-20 · Wallet [4.7.0](../VERSION)  
**Repo:** [thefear078/Phobia-Wallet](https://github.com/thefear078/Phobia-Wallet)

This replaces stale audits that still claim “missing LICENSE / CODEOWNERS / CoC / Dependabot”.
Those items are **done**. What remains before a **public beta** is mostly **code** (P0 fund-safety)
and **process** (EV certificate order) — not more markdown stubs.

---

## Phases (product first, stores later)

Legal and store markdown is **already written** — leave it alone while you ship coins, unless behaviour
changes. Engineering order:

1. **Core** — remaining fund-safety polish + **H.2 hardware wallets** ([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), [HARDWARE_WALLETS.md](HARDWARE_WALLETS.md))  
2. **Coins** — [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) + [adding-a-chain.md](adding-a-chain.md)  
3. **Stabilize** — leftover P1 / P2  
4. **Release prep** — EV cert (≥60 days), store submission, **external audit (R.5)**

Day-to-day: [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md). Doc links: `pwsh scripts/check-doc-links.ps1`.

## A. Documentation spider — DONE

- [x] [docs/INDEX.md](INDEX.md) hub + back-links on root/docs pages
- [x] [README.md](../README.md) navigation table + badges (CI, CodeQL, Security, release, **MIT**)
- [x] [getting-started.md](getting-started.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), [REPO_HARDENING.md](REPO_HARDENING.md)
- [x] [CONTACT.md](../CONTACT.md) — real channels (GitHub, Telegram, TikTok, Reddit, Advisories). **No** fake `legal@…example` addresses.

## B. Legal / brand — DONE

| Item | Status | Note |
|------|--------|------|

Live status detail: [REPO_HARDENING.md](REPO_HARDENING.md).

## D. Store readiness — docs DONE / UI + org OPEN

| Platform | Docs | Remaining |
|----------|------|-----------|
| GitHub side-load (primary) | ✅ | Keep shipping checksums |
| Apple App Store | ✅ notes | Org Apple account + L.1–L.8 **UI** + legal entity (R.2) |
| Google Play | ✅ notes | Business verification + L.1–L.8 **UI** |
| Microsoft Store | ✅ notes (§7) | EV/OV signing (R.2/R.6); optional Store listing (R.7) |
| Linux packages | ✅ notes | PGP package signing (L.6 / R.3) |

## E. Code gates before **public** beta — OPEN

Do **not** call a public beta “fund-safe” until these are green:

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| **P0.0** | Full restore proof (seed-only recover past gap) | ✅ `RestoreFromSeedProofTests` — finds **and spends** funds on issued address #15 after the local state is deleted |
| **P0.6** | Fail-closed balance (no fake `0.0000` on network error) | ✅ unread balances read “—” with a reason; the total says what it is missing |
| **P0.7** | Send-path transport gate (Tor settings enforced) | ✅ refused at Review **and** Confirm when the live route is not the chosen one |
| **P0.8** | Network isolation CI (Tor-only cannot clearnet) | ✅ own CI job; a loopback listener proves no socket is opened |
| L.1–L.3, L.8 | First-run disclaimer + 18+ + ToS/Privacy accept in UI | ✅ shipped — gates create/import/unlock, versioned acceptance, 6 languages |
| Tests | `dotnet test` green on CI | ✅ on `main` PRs |

Track in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) §3.

## F. Process (human) — OPEN

| Task | Owner | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| Order **OV/EV code signing** (R.2 / R.6) | Founder | Start **≥60 days** before Windows Store / SmartScreen goal |
| Confirm legal entity if submitting to Apple as org | Founder | Required by Apple 3.1.5 (i) |
| External audit (R.5) | Later | After beta stability — keep [AUDIT_STATUS.md](../AUDIT_STATUS.md) honest |

---

## Verdict

| Layer | Ready for public beta? |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Docs / legal / GitHub hardening | **Yes** |
| Philosophy consistency | **Yes** |
| Fund-safety P0 code + first-run UI | **Yes** for P0.0 / P0.6–P0.8 and the first-run UI; P0.1–P0.5 (supply-chain pins, checksum CI, capability matrix) remain |
| Store submission (Apple/Play/MS) | **Not yet** — the in-app disclaimers are done; a legal entity and code signing are not |

**Private / friends beta** on GitHub Releases is fine **today** if testers accept experimental risk and never put more than they can lose — and if CONTACT / SECURITY channels are used for bugs.
