# Phobia Wallet — documentation

Phobia is a **desktop-only**, self-custody crypto wallet (.NET 8 + Avalonia; Windows and Linux,
Android planned). There is **no web app and no backend server** — nothing to sign in to and nothing
that knows you exist.

**Start here:** **[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)** — full documentation map.

Product overview: [README.md](../README.md) · Backlog: [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) · Legal: [LEGAL/](../LEGAL/README.md)

## Engineering invariants

1. **`Core` never touches the network.**  
2. **Every human-typed amount goes through `AmountInput`.**  
3. **Every outbound request goes through `PublicHttp`.**  
4. **Never log a seed, key, or raw signed transaction.**  
5. **A network error is "unknown", never "empty".**  
6. **`CanSend: false` is an honest state.**
