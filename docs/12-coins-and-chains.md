## Quick answer: what Umbrella supports right now

### Coins you can send and receive today

| Coin | Network | Send | Receive | Tokens | Notes |
|------|---------|:----:|:-------:|:------:|-------|
| **Bitcoin** | Bitcoin | ✅ | ✅ | — | Most trusted, moderate fees |
| **Ethereum** | Ethereum | ✅ | ✅ | All ERC-20 | Gateway to DeFi |
| **USDT** | Tron (TRC-20) | ✅ | ✅ | — | Send works. Fee paid in TRX |
| **USDT** | Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Avalanche, TON | — | ✅ | — | **Receive and balance only.** Sending a token on these chains is not built yet |
| **USDC** | Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Polygon + more | — | ✅ | — | **Receive and balance only**, same reason |
| **BNB** | BNB Smart Chain | ✅ | ✅ | All BEP-20 | Binance native |
| **SOL** | Solana | ✅ | ✅ | All SPL | Ultra-fast |
| **TRX** | Tron | ✅ | ✅ | All TRC-20 | Powers USDT TRC-20 |
| **TON** | TON | ✅ | ✅ | Jettons (balance) | Telegram's coin |
| **ADA** | Cardano | ✅ | ✅ | Native assets | — |
| **XMR** | Monero | ✅ | ✅ | — | 🟢 Maximum privacy |
| **LTC** | Litecoin | ✅ | ✅ | — | Fast + cheap BTC |
| **BCH** | Bitcoin Cash | ✅ | ✅ | — | Cheap on-chain |
| **DOGE** | Dogecoin | ✅ | ✅ | — | Meme but real |
| **AVAX** | Avalanche | ✅ | ✅ | All ERC-20 | Fast EVM |
| **MATIC** | Polygon | ✅ | ✅ | All ERC-20 | Cheap EVM |
| **FTM** | Fantom | ✅ | ✅ | All ERC-20 | Fast EVM |
| **CRO** | Cronos | ✅ | ✅ | All ERC-20 | Crypto.com chain |
| **ETH** | Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Linea | ✅ | ✅ | All ERC-20 | Layer 2 — same 0x address, far cheaper |
| **ETH** | zkSync Era | ✅ | ✅ | — | Sends too: the gas limit comes from zkSync's own estimate, not Ethereum's flat 21,000 |
| **ZEC** | Zcash | ✅ | ✅ | — | Transparent `t1…` addresses only — Zcash's PUBLIC side, not a shielded z-address. The fee follows ZIP-317 and depends on how many coins fund the spend |
| **XRP** | XRP Ledger | ✅ | ✅ | — | With a destination tag for exchange deposits. An address becomes an account once it receives the network's reserve, which then stays locked |
| **XLM** | Stellar | ✅ | ✅ | — | Native XLM, with a text or ID memo for exchange deposits. An address becomes an account once someone funds it with 1 XLM; the first payment to a new address creates it |
| **ATOM** | Cosmos Hub | ✅ | ✅ | — | With a memo for exchange deposits. The balance is *available* ATOM — staked ATOM is not counted |
| **NEAR** | NEAR Protocol | ✅ | ✅ | — | Your implicit account (the 64-character hex id), to any `.near` name or implicit account. Named accounts of your own and staked NEAR are not shown |
| **DOT** | Polkadot | ✅ | ✅ | — | sr25519 like Polkadot.js / Nova; balance adds Asset Hub and the relay chain; sends go from Asset Hub, where balances now live |
| **XNO** | Nano | — | ✅ | — | Receive and balance. Restores in Ledger / Trust Wallet / Nault (BIP39). Incoming XNO waits as "receivable" until a wallet that signs pockets it; the balance includes it. Sending is not here yet |

> Any ERC-20 token (LINK, UNI, AAVE, SHIB, PEPE, etc.) is automatically detected and its
> balance shown when you link an Ethereum address. Same for TRC-20 on Tron and SPL on Solana.
>
> **ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum can now be sent** — the Send picker lists the ones you actually hold,
> and the transfer goes to the token's contract with the fee paid in ETH, not in the token. The
> wallet routes on the CONTRACT, never the ticker, because two contracts can call themselves USDC.
> A token whose contract never reported its decimals is refused rather than guessed at.
>
> **TRC-20 tokens on Tron can be sent too** — same rule, and the fee comes out of TRX
> (energy/bandwidth) rather than out of the token.
>
> **Jettons on TON can be sent** when the wallet knows their jetton-wallet contract — the message
> goes to that contract with about 0.05 TON attached for gas, part of which comes back. A jetton
> whose wallet address is unknown still says **Receive only** rather than offering a send.
>
> **SPL tokens on Solana send too.** Their balances are read under both token programs (the original
> and Token-2022), named for the well-known mints — each checked on-chain — and otherwise shown by mint
> address as *unverified*, folded away with suspected spam until they have a market price. Tokens of
> the original program can be sent: the fee is paid in SOL, and when the recipient has no account for
> that token yet the transfer creates one and your SOL pays its rent — the review says how much.
> Token-2022 tokens (PayPal USD among them) send too, as long as the mint's extensions cannot change
> what a plain transfer does. One that charges a transfer fee, runs a transfer hook, is paused or
> non-transferable, creates frozen accounts, or scales its displayed amount is refused in plain words
> and its row stays **Receive only**. If the token's issuer can freeze or seize it — PayPal USD's can —
> the review says so before you send.

## The most important thing to understand

### One seed phrase → all your addresses

When you create or import a wallet, one 24-word seed phrase generates ALL your addresses:

```
Your seed phrase
  ├── Bitcoin address:    bc1q...
  ├── Ethereum address:   0xAbCd...  ← also your BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum address
  ├── Tron address:       TXyz...
  ├── Solana address:     7abc...
  ├── TON address:        UQab...
  ├── Cardano address:    addr1...
  └── Monero address:     4xyz...    ← separate 25-word mnemonic
```

**What this means for you:**
- Same ETH address works on BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos
- You don't need separate wallets for each network
- Import your MetaMask seed → all your ETH balances appear automatically
- Monero is the only exception — it uses its own 25-word format

---

## USDT — which network to use

USDT is the same dollar value everywhere. The difference is the fee.

### Fee comparison

| Network | Fee | Speed | When to use |
|---------|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Solana** | **$0.0001** | 0.4 sec | Person-to-person, small amounts |
| **Base** | **$0.001–0.05** | 2 sec | Person-to-person, Coinbase users |
| **Polygon** | **$0.001–0.01** | 2 sec | Person-to-person, widely supported |
| **BSC** | $0.01–0.10 | 3 sec | Binance exchange withdrawals |
| **Arbitrum** | $0.01–0.20 | 1 sec | ETH ecosystem users |
| **Optimism** | $0.01–0.10 | 2 sec | ETH ecosystem users |
| **TRC-20 (Tron)** | $0.50–8* | 3 sec | P2P, Asian exchanges, OTC |
| **Avalanche** | $0.01–0.30 | 2 sec | AVAX ecosystem |
| **Ethereum (ERC-20)** | **$1–15** | 15 sec | DeFi, large amounts, maximum trust |
| **TON** | $0.01–0.05 | 5 sec | Telegram users |

\* *TRC-20 explanation below — it can be free if you stake TRX*

### Why TRC-20 fee is sometimes $8 — explained simply

Tron uses an energy system:
- USDT transfer = running a smart contract = costs Energy
- Energy comes from staking TRX (locking it up)
- **Fresh wallet with no staked TRX → Tron burns ~27 TRX ≈ $7-8 as fee**
- **Wallet with 10,000+ TRX staked → USDT transfers are FREE**

Most experienced traders who use USDT-TRC20 regularly will stake TRX once and then transfer USDT for free. If you're just starting — use Solana or Polygon for cheap transfers.

### Simple decision tree

```
Are you withdrawing from an exchange?
  → Use whatever network the exchange offers
  → Most exchanges support TRC-20 and ERC-20
  → Check the exchange's minimum withdrawal amount

Are you sending to another person?
  → Both have Solana: use Solana (cheapest)
  → Both have Polygon: use Polygon (cheap, reliable)
  → Unsure: use TRC-20 (most exchanges accept it)
  → Large amount ($1000+): use ERC-20 (most trusted)

Do you want maximum privacy?
  → USDT has NO privacy on any network (all public)
  → Use Monero (XMR) for truly private transfers
```

## Understanding tokens vs. coins

### Coins (native)
Every blockchain has one native coin used to pay fees:
- Bitcoin → BTC (fees in BTC)
- Ethereum → ETH (fees in ETH — called "gas")
- Tron → TRX (fees from TRX energy)
- Solana → SOL (fees in SOL)
- BNB Smart Chain → BNB (fees in BNB)

### Tokens (ride on top)
Tokens use an existing blockchain and pay fees in the native coin:
- USDT on Tron → TRC-20 token, fees paid in TRX
- USDT on Ethereum → ERC-20 token, fees paid in ETH
- USDT on BSC → BEP-20 token, fees paid in BNB
- USDT on Solana → SPL token, fees paid in SOL

**Common mistake:** "I received USDT on Tron but can't send it" → You have USDT but no TRX to pay the fee. You need a small amount of TRX (or staked TRX) in the same address.

---

## Receiving crypto — step by step

### 1. Open Receive tab
Select the coin you want to receive.

### 2. Make sure you're on the right network
⚠️ **Critical:** USDT on TRC-20 and USDT on ERC-20 are different addresses.
- Your TRX address (T...) — for USDT TRC-20
- Your ETH address (0x...) — for USDT ERC-20, also BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum
- Your SOL address — for USDT SPL

### A fresh address for every payment

On Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Dogecoin the Receive screen hands out a **new address each
time** you ask. Reusing one address means every payment you have ever received sits under a single
public heading that anyone can read — a fresh one per payment breaks that link.

The wallet only offers this where it can also **find and spend** what arrives: the balance is scanned
across every address it has issued, not just the first one, and a send signs across all of them. An
address the wallet could hand out but never scan would be money you watch arrive and can never move,
so the two lists are pinned to each other in the test suite.

### 3. Copy address or show QR
- Click "Copy" — address goes to clipboard (auto-cleared after 45 seconds)
- Show QR — sender scans with their phone or app

### 4. Confirm amount (optional)
For Bitcoin and Monero, you can include an exact amount in the QR code — the sender's wallet will auto-fill it.

### 5. Wait for confirmation
| Network | Typical confirmation time |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Solana | ~1 second |
| BSC | ~3 seconds |
| Tron | ~3 seconds |
| Polygon | ~2 seconds |
| Ethereum | 15–30 seconds |
| Bitcoin | 10–60 minutes |
| Monero | ~2 minutes |
| Cardano | ~1 minute |
| TON | ~5 seconds |

---

## Sending crypto — step by step

### 1. Open Send tab
Select the coin you want to send.

### 2. Enter the recipient address
- Paste from clipboard
- Or scan their QR code
- The wallet validates the address format and warns if it looks wrong

⚠️ **Double-check the address.** Crypto transactions are irreversible. A wrong address means lost funds — permanently.

### 3. Enter the amount
- You can enter in the coin (e.g., 0.001 BTC)
- Or in USD equivalent (e.g., $50)
- "Send all" button available (accounts for fee automatically)

### 4. Review the fee
The wallet shows:
- Network fee (paid to miners/validators, not to Umbrella)
- Total cost (amount + fee)
- Estimated confirmation time

**Fee levels available for Bitcoin and Litecoin:**
- Economy (~1h) — lowest fee, slower
- Standard (~30min) — recommended
- Priority (~10min) — highest fee, fastest

### 5. Confirm and send
- Review screen shows all details
- Your seed phrase is decrypted temporarily to sign the transaction
- Only the signed transaction bytes go to the network — your private key never leaves your device
- After broadcast, the screen shows the transaction hash

### 6. Track your transaction
Click the transaction hash to open the block explorer and see confirmation status.

---

## Automatic token detection

When you link a wallet address (ETH, TRX, SOL, or TON), the wallet automatically finds all your tokens:

**Ethereum address:**
- Checks Blockscout for all ERC-20 tokens
- Shows: USDT, USDC, DAI, SHIB, LINK, UNI, AAVE, and any other token you hold

**Tron address:**
- Checks TronScan for all TRC-20 tokens (up to 40)
- Shows: USDT, USDC, WTRX, JST, SUN, BTT, and all others

**Solana address:**
- Checks all SPL token accounts
- Shows: USDT, USDC, RAY, BONK, WIF, JTO, JUP, and all others

**TON address:**
- Checks toncenter's index for all Jettons (up to 40)
- Shows: USD₮ (Tether on TON), NOT, DOGS, and all others
- Balance only for now — Jettons are read, not sent

**Adding a custom token manually:**
1. Go to Settings → Add Token
2. Paste the contract address
3. Wallet reads the name, symbol, and decimals automatically
4. Token appears in your portfolio

## Privacy — honest explanation per coin

### 🟢 Monero (XMR) — maximum privacy
Every transaction hides:
- Who sent it (ring signatures — 15 decoy senders)
- Who received it (stealth addresses)
- How much was sent (RingCT — encrypted amounts)

No one, not even blockchain analysis companies, can see your balance or transactions without your ViewKey. This is why Monero is used by privacy-conscious individuals worldwide.

> **This is not only a Monero thing.** Every chain is read through somebody's server, and on a
> transparent chain that server is handed your actual addresses. **Settings → Privacy → Where each
> chain is read from** lets you pick a different company or point at your own server, for Bitcoin,
> Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Solana, TON, Tron and Cardano.

**The part most wallets do not tell you: the node.**

A Monero wallet cannot read the chain by itself — it has to ask some machine, and unless you run
your own, that machine belongs to somebody else. Umbrella used to pick one for you silently. It no
longer does: **Settings → Privacy → Monero node** shows exactly which machine is being asked, lets
you choose a different one, and lets you point at your own.

What the node can see:

- The IP that connected to it — an exit node instead of your home address when Tor is on
- That the IP belongs to a Monero wallet
- Roughly which range of blocks that wallet asked for
- When you are online
- When you send, that this connection is where the transaction entered the network

What the node cannot see:

- Your keys — they never leave your machine
- Your balance, your addresses, or the amounts — Monero encrypts those on the chain itself

A `.onion` node can be pasted into the custom field and will **only** ever be used with Tor on; with
Tor off it cannot resolve at all, and the wallet says so rather than falling back to somebody else.
Likewise, if the Tor-only kill-switch is armed and Tor is down, no node is used at all — connecting
to a clearnet node in that state would hand out the very IP the kill-switch exists to hide.

### 🟡 Bitcoin with Tor — medium privacy
Bitcoin is a public ledger — every transaction is visible. However:
- Umbrella routes Bitcoin queries through Tor → your IP is not linked to your address
- Fresh address per receive → harder to link transactions
- Still: anyone with your address can see your balance and full history

### 🔴 Ethereum, Tron, Solana, BSC, etc. — low privacy
Fully public blockchains. Anyone can:
- See your complete transaction history
- See your current balance
- Track movements between addresses

This is not specific to Umbrella — it's how these blockchains work. For private transfers, use Monero.

---

## Common questions

### "I sent ETH to my BSC address by mistake"
Good news: ETH and BSC use the same 0x address. Your funds are on BSC, not Ethereum.
Switch the network in your wallet to BSC to see and access them.

### "My USDT shows $0 even though I know I have it"
Check which network you're on:
- USDT on Tron → need to be viewing Tron address (T...)
- USDT on Ethereum → need to be viewing ETH address (0x...)
- The same address on different networks holds different USDT

### "Why does sending USDT on Tron cost $8?"
Your wallet has no staked TRX. See the TRC-20 fee section above.
Quick fix: stake some TRX, or use Solana USDT instead.

### "The transaction was sent but shows as pending for hours"
Bitcoin: normal during network congestion. Economy-fee transactions may wait 1-24h.
ETH: usually confirms in minutes. If stuck: the fee may have been too low during a congestion spike.
Solana: if not confirmed in 30 seconds, it was likely dropped — retry.

### "Can Umbrella see my balance or transactions?"
No. Balances are fetched directly from public blockchain nodes and explorers — no Umbrella server is involved. When Tor is enabled, even the blockchain nodes don't see your real IP.

### "What happens to my coins if Umbrella shuts down?"
Your coins are safe. They live on the blockchain, not in any app. Import your 24-word seed phrase into any BIP39-compatible wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger, etc.) and you have full access. Umbrella is just an interface.

### "My Monero balance is 0 but I know I received XMR"
Monero requires scanning the blockchain with your ViewKey to find incoming transactions. Make sure the bundled monero-wallet-rpc is running (you'll see a status indicator in the app). Initial sync can take 10-60 minutes depending on how many blocks need scanning.

If it never starts scanning at all, check the node under **Settings → Privacy → Monero node** — the
status line there names the machine actually being asked, and says plainly when none is being used
(a `.onion` node with Tor off, or any node while the Tor-only kill-switch is armed and Tor is down).

## Fees — complete reference

### How fees work

| Chain type | Fee paid in | Who sets the fee | Can you control it? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Bitcoin | BTC | Market (miners) | ✅ Economy / Standard / Priority |
| Ethereum | ETH | Market (validators) | ✅ Gas price selector |
| Tron TRX/TRC-20 | TRX (or Energy) | Protocol fixed | ⚠️ Stake TRX to make it free |
| Solana | SOL | Protocol fixed | ❌ Always ~$0.0001 |
| BSC | BNB | Market | ✅ Gas price |
| Polygon | MATIC | Market | ✅ Gas price |
| TON | TON | Protocol | ❌ Fixed |
| Cardano | ADA | Protocol | ❌ Calculated automatically |
| Monero | XMR | Dynamic | ✅ Priority selector |
| L2 (Arbitrum/Base/OP) | ETH | L2 sequencer | Limited |

### Fee tips

**Bitcoin:** Use Economy fee for non-urgent transfers. Save 50-70% vs Priority.

**Ethereum:** Check gas price before sending. Monday-Thursday morning UTC is usually cheapest. Avoid NFT mint rushes.

**USDT TRC-20:** Stake TRX once, send USDT free forever. Or switch to Solana.

**Monero:** Standard priority is fine for most uses. Only use high priority if urgency matters.

## Security — how your coins are protected

### Your private keys never leave your device

The wallet works like this:
1. Your seed phrase is encrypted with Argon2id (designed to be very slow to crack) + AES-256-GCM
2. When you unlock with your password, the seed is decrypted in memory only
3. When you send, the private key is derived temporarily, used to sign, then cleared from memory
4. Only the signed transaction (bytes) is sent to the network
5. The network cannot reverse-engineer your private key from a signed transaction

### What protects you from hackers

| Threat | Protection |
|--------|-----------|
| Someone screenshots your seed phrase | Window goes BLACK — screenshot tools see nothing |
| Malware captures your screen | Same as above — OS-level protection |
| Man-in-the-middle network attack | All connections via Tor (optional), HTTPS |
| Someone brute-forces your password | Argon2id KDF — costs $1000+ per guess on GPU |
| Exchange gets hacked | Your coins aren't on an exchange — they're in your wallet |
| Umbrella's servers get hacked | Servers never had your keys — nothing to steal |

### What you must protect yourself

| Risk | What to do |
|------|-----------|
| Losing your seed phrase | Write 24 words on paper, store securely offline |
| Weak wallet password | Use 12+ characters, mix of types |
| Sending to wrong address | Always verify the first and last 4 characters |
| Phishing (fake Umbrella site) | Always download from official GitHub only |
| Keylogger on your PC | Keep system clean, use antivirus |

## Coming soon — roadmap

### Near term (months 1-2)

| Feature | What it means for you |
|---------|-----------------------|
| Send any ERC-20 token | Currently send ETH native; soon send USDT, USDC, LINK, etc. on ETH |
| Send any TRC-20 token | Send any token on Tron, not just USDT |
| Confidential Token-2022 transfers | The private-balance mode some Token-2022 mints offer; ordinary transfers of them already send |
| Native zkSync paymasters | Paying the fee in a token instead of ETH; ordinary zkSync sends already work |

### Medium term (months 3-6)

| Feature | What it means |
|---------|--------------|
| XRP support | Fast international transfers |
| Stellar (XLM) | Ultra-cheap microtransactions |
| Cosmos (ATOM) | IBC multi-chain ecosystem |
| Coin control (BTC) | Choose exactly which UTXOs to spend — better privacy |
| Zcash shielded | Send with zero-knowledge proofs |
| Duress password | Open decoy wallet if forced to unlock |

### Security and privacy hardening

Agreed priorities, in the order they are worth doing. None of these is implemented yet, and the
threat model names each one as an open gap rather than implying it away.

| Item | Why it is on this list |
|---|---|
| **Reproducible builds** | Today, verifying a checksum verifies against the same release an attacker would have had to compromise. Determinism is what makes the binary provably the published source. |
| **Signed releases** (GPG / Sigstore) | Checksums prove integrity against accidental corruption, not against a replaced release. |
| ~~Tor stream isolation~~ | **Done.** Chain data, broadcasts, prices, swaps, exchange accounts and maintenance each get their own circuit. |
| **Dandelion++** | Broadcasting by flood lets an observer tie an IP to a transaction by propagation timing. A stem phase breaks that. |
| ~~Taproot (BIP-341)~~ | **Found and spent; not yet issued.** A seed used in a Taproot wallet shows its `m/86'` coins and history and can spend them (key-path, alone or mixed with SegWit inputs). The wallet still hands out native SegWit receive addresses: switching the default is a separate decision, and an empty BTC scan already costs twice the probes it did. |
| ~~PayJoin (BIP-78)~~ | **Sending done.** When a payment link offers it, the receiver adds a coin of its own, which breaks the "all inputs belong to the sender" assumption chain analysis is built on. The wallet cannot *receive* a PayJoin: that needs an endpoint reachable whenever someone pays, which a desktop app is not. |
| **CoinJoin** | The heavier answer to UTXO linkage; worth doing after PayJoin. |
| **Hardware wallets** (Ledger / Trezor) | The only real answer to Vector 1 of the threat model — malware on the user's own machine. |

### Long term

| Feature | What it means |
|---------|--------------|
| Ledger hardware wallet | Sign transactions with physical device |
| Android app | Mobile wallet (same seed, full features) |
| Silent Payments (BTC) | Bitcoin privacy without address reuse |
| Multisig | 2-of-3 signatures for shared control |
