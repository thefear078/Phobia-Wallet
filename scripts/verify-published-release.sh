# Verify a PUBLISHED GitHub release against its own checksum manifest (roadmap P0.3).
#
# The release workflow already self-verifies before publishing: it downloads the attached artifacts,
# checks the expected set is complete, generates SHA256SUMS and runs `sha256sum -c` over it. What it
# cannot check is what the release page serves AFTERWARDS — an asset replaced or re-uploaded later
# looks exactly like the original to anybody who trusts the page.
#
# So this downloads what the release actually serves, right now, and checks every file against the
# manifest attached to it. It is the same thing a user does by hand from SECURITY.md, which is the
# point: the instructions the project gives people are run by the project too.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/verify-published-release.sh            # the latest release
#   bash scripts/verify-published-release.sh v4.8.2     # a specific tag
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated), sha256sum.
